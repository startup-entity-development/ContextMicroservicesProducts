I mainly used this peanut oil for deep frying egg rolls or fried chicken. It works and the foods taste good; however, it doesn't make your foods taste significantly better than other oils in my opinion. When you use this oil you can't necessarily tell that it's peanut oil which is a good thing. I also used this oil when cooking most foods on a regular frying pan on an electric stovetop like scrambled eggs or vegetable stir fry since peanut oil has a high smoke point. Peanut oil has a higher smoke point than olive oil and some other vegetable oils which is good.

At first I thought they were fake online, but they are definitely real fresh cut flowers with flower food and a glass vase. The flowers were beautiful when they arrived. What I will say is in order to make it look like the photo you would have to cut the stems different lengths so that you get the dimension that it looks like in the photo online. You can see for mine I put them in the vase as is and they’re all the same length so it looks a bit different then the online photo.

The bottle is now plastic and not glass like it used to be so there’s little issue of dropping and breaking it. The top opens easily and there is a pull tab inside that, when pulled, creates a small opening that allows the vinegar to pour easily without going all over the place. It makes it easy for pouring a small amount directly onto a salad but not so slow it would take all day to pour it into a bowl for making dressing. I found the vinegar to smell slightly fruity and much less harsh than regular white distilled vinegar. The taste is crisp and clean which is perfect for brightening up salads, poultry, seafood, soups, dressings and more. It’s a great calorie free way to add a bit of acidity or splash of flavor to a favorite recipe. Try a bottle out if you’re looking for an everyday option.
